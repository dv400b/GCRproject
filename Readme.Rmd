INPUT:  smartphone sensor data in a directory "UCI HAR Dataset" located in the same directory as 
the script run_analysis.R

OUTPUT:  a processed, tidy data set run_analysis_summary.txt, located in the same directory as
the script run_analysis.R

HOW THE SCIPT WORKS:
After defining the the location of the data directory and files, the global (top-level) feature
and activity codes are read.  Then a list of subdirectories to furtrher read ("train", "test") is
defined.  For each item in this list, the "Subject", "Y", and "X" files are then loaded;
a large data.frame is made from these three files.  Finally, the train and test data.frames
are merged into a single aggregate data.frame (df.all).  From this, a summary data.frame is
built consisting of the average value of each sensor field for each subject and activity,
and written to run_analysis_summary.txt.
